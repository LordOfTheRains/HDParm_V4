1.	Which register number is used for the stack pointer (sp) in OS/161?
29

2.	What bus/busses does OS/161 support?
LAMEbus

3.	What is the difference between splhigh and spl0?
Splhigh: sets priority high which will disable all interrupts.
Spl0: sets priority to 0 which will enable all interrupts

4.	Why do we use typedefs like u_int32_t instead of simply saying “int”?
Different system architectures can have different ways of representing “int”, a more explicit definition such as “u_int32_t removes ambiguity and allows for portability.
 
5.	What does splx return?
Oldspl

6.	What is the highest interrupt level?
15

7.	How frequently are hardlock interrupts generated?
100hz, or 100 times per second

8.	What functions comprise the standard interface to a VFS device?
fs_setcurdir, vfs_clearcurdir, vfs_getcurdir, vfs_sync, vfs_getroot, vfs_getdevname, vfs_lookup, vfs_lookparent, vfs_open, vfs_close, vfs_readlink, vfs_symlink, vfs_mkdir, vfs_link, vfs_remove, vfs_rmdir, vfs_rename, vfs_chdir, vfs_getcwd, vfs_bootstrap, vfs_initbootfs, vfs_setbootfs, vfs_clearbootfs, vfs_adddev, vfs_addfs, vfs_mount, vfs_unmount, and vfs_unmountall

9.	How many characters are allowed in a volume name?
32

10.	How many direct blocks does an SFS file have?
512 bytes

11.	What is the standard interface to a file system (i.e., what functions must you implement to implement a new file system)?
12.	What function puts a thread to sleep?
thread_sleep

13.	How large are OS/161 pids?
4

14.	What operations can you do on a vnode?
emufs_loadvnode, emufs_open, emufs_opendir, emufs_close, emufs_reclaim, emufs_read, emufs_getdirentry, emufs_write, emufs_ioctl, emufs_stat, emufs_file_gettype, emufs_dir_gettype, emufs_tryseek, emufs_fsync, emufs_truncate, emufs_creat, emufs_lookup, emufs_lookparent, emufs_namefile

15.	What is the max path length in OS/161?
1024

16.	What is the system call number for a reboot?
0

17.	Where is STDIN_FILENO defined?
Kern/include/unistd.h:52

18.	Is it OK to initialize the thread system before the scheduler? Why or why not?
No. The schedulers handle how threads are setup and run, initializing the thread system before would be a disaster.

19.	What is a zombie?
A dead thread that is doing nothing but eating the computer’s brains. It must be destroyed.

20.	How large is the initial run queue?
32

21.	What does a device name in OS/161 look like?
“lhd0”

22.	What does a raw device name in OS/161 look like?
“lhd0raw”

23.	What lock protects the vnode reference count?
lock *vn_countlock

24.	What device types are currently supported?
It supports the same devices as FreeBSD, so most devices.
